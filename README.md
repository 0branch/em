# EM
This is the Editor for Mortals 'em' by George Coulouris.  An ancestor of 'ex/vi'.

# INFO
This contains the original fixed em code.

The goal is to merge as much as possible from the 'merges' branch into master.  Creating the definitive 'em'.

# CURRENT
Currently I have merged the useful parts of CUNY and KENT as well as one part of AUASM (as well as reimplementing standard UNIX signals from illumos) into master.  Other parts were mainly useful for timesharing (allowing the editing of files not owned by you, or setting chmod on files that were changed).  Since we don't do that anymore, it's pointless including it.
