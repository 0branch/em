# em
This is the Editor for Mortals 'em' by George Coulouris.  An ancestor of 'ex/vi'.

# info
This contains the original fixed em code.
It is not all totally my doing, I have used some patches from Ultrix,
BSD and SunOS/Open Solaris to help add features and deal with modern terminal emulators.

So far I have the original em merged with the KENT and partially merged with the CUNY differences.
Works nicely on macOS and GNU/Linux in 64bit.
